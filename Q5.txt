The basic structure of the calculator project involves HTML for structure and content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Hereâ€™s a summary of what each function in the provided JavaScript code does:

JavaScript Function Summaries:
getHistory():

Retrieves the text content of the element with ID history-value, representing the historical operations or expressions.
printHistory(num):

Updates the text content of the element with ID history-value with the provided num, displaying the historical operations or expressions.
getOutput():

Retrieves the text content of the element with ID output-value, representing the current output or result of calculations.
printOutput(num):

Updates the text content of the element with ID output-value with the provided num. If num is not empty, formats it with commas for better readability using getFormattedNumber(num).
getFormattedNumber(num):

Formats the given num by converting it into a locale-specific string representation with commas for thousand separators. Handles special case for - to return an empty string.
reverseNumberFormat(num):

Converts a formatted number string num (with commas) back into a plain number by removing all commas using a regular expression.
Event Listeners for Operators (operator):

Iterates over all elements with the class operator (like +, -, *, /, =, clear, backspace).
Handles different operator clicks: clears history and output, performs backspace functionality, evaluates expressions when = is clicked, and updates both history and output displays accordingly.
Event Listeners for Numbers (number):

Iterates over all elements with the class number.
Concatenates the clicked number to the current output value, updating the output display.
Basic Code Structure:
HTML: Defines structure with elements for history and output display, operator buttons, and number buttons.

CSS: Provides styles for layout, button appearance, and overall design.

JavaScript: Manages the interactive behavior of the calculator:

Defines functions (getHistory, printHistory, etc.) to interact with HTML elements.
Sets up event listeners to respond to user interactions (clicks on numbers and operators).
Handles logic for input processing, calculation, and updating display elements (history-value and output-value).
